It is an webapp which tells the user whether they look more like a dog person or a cat person. Flask framework of Python is used 
to create an webapp. [Clmtrackr](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr), a javascript library by [Audun Mathias Ã˜ygard](https://github.com/auduno), is used to collect information about the users face. It uses an SVM model to recognize faces. Based on the different features of the users face, I determine whether the user looks like a cat person or a dog person. 


### Follow the instructions below to run this webapp in your computer 
1. Downalod Python 3.5 or greater
2. Install flask (pip install flask)
3. Clone or download this repo
4. Open terminal and run CatOrDog.py (python CatOrDog/CatOrDog.py)
5. Open your browser (preferbly Chrome) and go to 127.0.0.1:5000
6. Have fun

Once you have the webapp running, you can check for whether you look like a cat person or a dog person. The initial page should like the one below:

It will immediately start tracking your face. After you click on Check, it will run some calculations on your face features and then you will get a pop up about whether you are a cat person or a dog person.
